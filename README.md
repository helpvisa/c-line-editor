# ded - Dan's Editor
## You should NOT use this text editor!

"Dan's Editor" was built as an exercise in writing a text editor in C. It is
inspired mainly by ed.

As I work my way through the C Programming Language, I will likely come back
update / divide the program as needed, to create something that is, at least
in some small way, actually usable!

Without a make file, if you'd like to try using this editor for yourself, you
can type `gcc -o <filename>.out ./editor.c`, replacing \<filename\> with a name
of your choosing. You can then run the editor from the terminal as you would
any other executable, appending the file you would like to edit as an arg.
