# ded - Dan's EDitor
## You should NOT use this text editor!

That said, this file was written and saved using ded.

Dan's EDitor (ded) was built as an exercise in writing a line editor in C. It is
inspired mainly by ed.

As I work my way through the C Programming Language, I will likely come back and
update / divide the program as needed, to create something that is, at least
in some small way, actually usable!

Without a make file, if you'd like to try using this editor for yourself, you
can type `gcc -o <filename> ./editor.c`, replacing \<filename\> with a name
of your choosing. You can then run the editor from the terminal as you would
any other executable, appending the file you would like to edit as an arg,
like so: `./<filename> <editable>`.
